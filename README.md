![RHIT Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henthornlab/ProcessAnalytics/refs/heads/master/RHITlogo.png)

During this installation, we installed a Coriolis flow meter, a pressure meter, a level sensor, and an RTD.
- The Coriolis flow meter measures flow by measuring the torque through controlled generation of Coriolis force. 
- The pressure meter will measure the pressure using the height and weight of the liquid in a tank.
- The level sensor will measure the level by finding the difference between the liquid height and the reference point.
- The RTD will measure temperature.

The instruments tag and specifications are shown in the table below.

| Instrument | Tag | Manufacturer | Model |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------|----------|

| Pressure Transmitter | PIT525A | Endress + Hauser | Delta Pilot S |
| Level Sensor | LIT525A | Endress + Hauser | Micropilot FMR63B |
| RTD | TE525A | Burns Engineering | Series 200 |

We also created the control panel and installed all of the necessary components to control the new instrumentation through the DeltaV system.
